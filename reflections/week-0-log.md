## Day 2 (Nov 22)
**Completed"":
- Learn git branching tutorial (Main + Remote sections)
- Created practice branch
- Made 3 commits on branch
- Merged branch to main

**Struggled with**:
- It was pretty much simple, although I'd revisit git merge and rebase in my spare time to understand it's why/how part in more detail.

**Learned**:
- Started with commir, these are in plain terms only a snapshot of main repository.
- Branches are just pointers, not copies of code.
- It's like managing a copy paste logs, but in very advanced manner.

**Tomorrow**:
- More git practice (10 commits)
- Branch creation and merging practice
