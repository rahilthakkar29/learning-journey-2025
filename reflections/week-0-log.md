## Day 2 (Nov 22)
**Completed"":
- Learn git branching tutorial (Main + Remote sections)
- Created practice branch
- Made 3 commits on branch
- Merged branch to main

**Struggled with**:
- It was pretty much simple, although I'd revisit git merge and rebase in my spare time to understand it's why/how part in more detail.

**Learned**:
- Started with commir, these are in plain terms only a snapshot of main repository.
- Branches are just pointers, not copies of code.
- It's like managing a copy paste logs, but in very advanced manner.

**Tomorrow**:
- More git practice (10 commits)
- Branch creation and merging practice

## Day 3 (Nov 26) ✅
**Time**: 120 mins
**Completed**:
- Made 10+ practice commits
- Created and merged 3 branches
- Deleted branches (safe and force)
- Installed Go (version: go1.25.4 )
- Completed Tour of Go basics
- Created first Go program

**Git Skills Practiced**:
- Branch creation: git checkout -b
- Branch switching: git checkout / git switch
- Merging: git merge
- Branch deletion: git branch -d / -D
- Viewing history: git log --oneline --graph

**Go Setup**:
- Installed Go successfully
- Created Go module
- Ran first Go program

**Struggled with**:
- Not struggled, but trying to gasp what I've gone through in go tour. There are a lot of things I read there and practices but even with variables there are numerous ways to define the variable like "var var_name vartype = value" or "var_name := value", or something else(maybe I already forgot). Other things is for loop, I know how loop works, but definition wise it's literally a while loop because in the end the for loop was like for x > 10 {do this}. Then if part, it was easy but when it started with inside if you can add condition like if math.pow(something); v > power {} I was quite lost there. But defining functions, function parameters, return types, more than one return type, imports, import ("" "") all those parts were quite easy to catch.

**What clicked**:
- Did a lot commits, so commit part and how git branching works and merging works, etc clicked today with practice.

**Tomorrow**:
- Read networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, HTTP)
- Take notes on how the internet works
